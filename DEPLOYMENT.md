# Deployment Guide for Fine Builders & Interiors

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Code Quality & Build
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run check`)
- [x] Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] Development server runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [x] Production server starts successfully (`npm run start`)

### ✅ Dependencies & Security
- [x] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [x] Security vulnerabilities addressed (6 moderate vulnerabilities remain - mostly dev dependencies)
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility (cross-env added for Windows/Linux/Mac)

### ⚠️ Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure)
- [ ] Configure database connection if needed (currently using in-memory storage)
- [ ] Set production domain/URL in environment

### ✅ Static Assets
- [x] All images present in `/public/images/` directory
- [x] Logo and branding assets available
- [x] Font assets loaded from CDN (Google Fonts, Font Awesome)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit environment variables
# Set NODE_ENV=production
# Configure DATABASE_URL if using PostgreSQL
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Start Production Server
```bash
npm run start
```

## Server Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.20.8 or higher
- **Memory**: Minimum 512MB RAM
- **Storage**: ~100MB for application files
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)

## Database Configuration

Currently using in-memory storage. For production:

1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Configure `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Run database migrations: `npm run db:push`

## Security Considerations

### Remaining Vulnerabilities
- 6 moderate severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies
- esbuild version needs update (affects development only)
- Consider running `npm audit fix --force` for breaking changes

### Production Security
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add security headers middleware
- [ ] Configure session secrets

## Performance Optimizations

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Vite build optimization
- CSS/JS minification and bundling
- Static asset serving
- Efficient React component structure

### Recommended Additions
- [ ] Add compression middleware (gzip)
- [ ] Implement caching headers
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets
- [ ] Consider image optimization

## Monitoring & Logging

### Current Logging
- Express request logging for API routes
- Basic server startup logging

### Recommended Additions
- [ ] Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Structured logging

## Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Database backup strategy
- [ ] Static asset backup
- [ ] Environment configuration backup

## Domain & DNS

- [ ] Configure domain DNS records
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) if needed

## Final Verification

Before going live:
1. Test all pages load correctly
2. Verify contact form functionality
3. Check responsive design on mobile devices
4. Test performance with tools like Lighthouse
5. Verify SEO meta tags and Open Graph data
